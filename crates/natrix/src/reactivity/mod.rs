//! Reactivity system for tracking dependencies and updates.
//!
//! The reactivity system is deeply integrated throughout the framework to enable
//! fine-grained updates. Key concepts:
//!
//! - **`Signal<T>`**: Reactive data primitives that track reads/writes
//! - **`State` trait**: Marker for types that can be used as reactive state
//! - **Context types**: `InnerCtx`, `RenderCtx`, `EventCtx`, `AsyncCtx` for different execution phases
//! - **Reactive hooks**: Track dependencies and trigger targeted DOM updates
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The system has intentional cross-cutting concerns:
//! - DOM elements become reactive through the `Element` trait (in `dom/`)
//! - Reactive hooks for DOM updates live in `dom_hooks.rs`
//! - The scheduler and hook storage live in `core.rs`
//! - Higher-level features like `watch` and `guards` build on the core primitives
